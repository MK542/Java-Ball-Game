# Java-Ball-Game
This is just a small Java game I made to experiment with some features.  

A target is randomly spawned on the game board and the user can choose direction and power of the ball.
The ball will bounce off the walls if it makes contact with them.
There is a frictional element and the ball will eventually stop without any user input.
